# Unit Converter

Is all that unit conversion making you want to rip your hair out? Can't remember
how many shakes go into a Swatch beat? Keep confusing your English ells with
your Scottish faws? Need a command line utility to change your kelvins into
degrees Rankine? Well, the first two are lost causes for sure, but for that last
one, maybe this handy-dandy command line unit converter will help you out!

This repository contains the source code for a command line application for
performing unit conversion, written in Rust. It's not really intended for
dimensional analysis but I'm sure you could get it to work if you were
particularly determined to jump down that rabbit hole.
