## Database of SI items.
## 
## This file contains descriptions of units and items that, together, constitute
## the International System of Units (SI), as specified in the SI Brochure.
## The supremacy of the SI is beyond question; almost all other systems of units
## define their primitives in terms of SI units.
## 
## The *set of coherent SI units* have special
## status as the reference units. These units are assigned a magnitude of one by
## the Unit Converter; thus, unit conversion can be described as converting to
## and from some relevant coherent SI unit.



## Base dimensions.
## 
## This section describes the base dimensions in use by the SI. These are *not*
## the base dimensions described by the SI brochure; in particular, since this
## converter cannot handle dimensionless quantities, the quantities of plane and
## solid angle are described as base dimensions.

# TODO learn more about field and power logarithmic quantities and how they
# relate to each other. It seems that a generic conversion between units of LOGE
# and LOGD is impossible because of the ambiguity of whether the units describe
# field quantities or power quantities; conversion is only meaningful when they
# are precisely defined. I think W-records are probably the right mechanism for
# getting this behaviour.

# TODO Maybe the use of "intervals" might be better? Plus it would generalize
# better with things like musical cents and whatnot.

## The neper.

## natural logarithmic ratio quantities.
