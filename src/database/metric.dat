## Database of items associated with the metric system.
## 
## This file contains descriptions of units and items that are in common use in
## the "metric system" outside of the scope of the SI. This includes "metric"
## units that predate the SI or enjoy common use within the scientific or
## international community despite not having official status within the SI.



# TODO Citations for all of this!



## Alternative forms of SI prefixes.

## I remember having an old composition notebook way back in 5th grade with a
## table of metric prefixed printed on the inside cover, and I could swear that
## the table showed the symbol for deka- (with a k 'cause America) as being
## "dk".
P | dk | 1e1

## For ASCII compatibility purposes, the symbol u- is often used to represent
## micro-. In certain reliability-critical contexts, the symbol mc- is
## occasionally used to represent micro- as well.

## The Martian mean solar day, symbol: sol, accepted to be 24 hours, 39 minutes,
## and 35.244 seconds [1].
## 
## There does not appear to be any official position as to whether the Martial
## mean solar day is *defined* to be this value or *accepted* to be this value,
## so in my *clearly apparent* capacity as an adjudicator on this matter, I am
## going to decree that the Martial mean solar day is *accepted* to be this
## value. This is the first step to fulfilling my isekai power fantasies. No one
## can stop me.
## 
## While subdivisions of the Martian mean solar day exist (in the form analogous
## to Terrestrial hours, minutes, and seconds), there do not appear to be any
## commonly accepted symbols for these units that do not clash with the symbols
## for their analogous Terrestrial units.

# subject of a huge internet fight.
