## Database of British Imperial and US Customary units of length and mass.
## 
## This file contains descriptions of units of length and mass that follow from
## the adoption of the international yard and pound avoirdupois and which form
## the basis for the British Imperial and US Customary systems of units, where
## they agree.


## The (international) yard, defined as exactly 0.914 4 metres [1].
U | yd | LEN | 0.914 4

## The (international) foot, defined as exactly 1/3 (international) yards.
U | ft | LEN | 0.304 8

## The (international) inch, defined as exactly 1/12 (international) feet.
U | in | LEN | 0.025 4

## The (international) rod, defined as exactly 16.5 (internationl) feet.
U | rd | LEN | 5.029 2

## The (international) furlong, defined as exactly 40 (international) rods.
U | fur | LEN | 201.168

## The (international) mile, defined as exactly 8 (international) rods.
U | mi | LEN | 1 609.344



# The mile is not defined here...



## The (international) pound avoirdupois, defined as exactly 0.453 592 37 kg
## [1].
U | lb | MAS | 0.453 592 37

## The (international) ounce avoirdupois, defined as exactly 1/16 lb.
U | oz | MAS | 0.028 349 523 125



## The pound-force, defined as 1 (international) pound avoirdupois multiplied by
## the standard acceleration due to gravity (itself defined as exactly
## 9.806 65 m/s²).
U | lbf | MAS * LEN * TIM^-2 | 4.448 221 615 260 5

## The ounce-force, defined as 1 (international) ounce avoirdupois multiplied by
## the standard acceleration due to gravity (itself defined as exactly
## 9.806 65 m/s²).
U | ozf | MAS * LEN * TIM^-2 | 0.278 013 850 953 781 25

## Sometimes, symbols of units of mass are used to represent their equivalent
## standard-acceleration-due-to-gravity force units.
U | lb | MAS * LEN * TIM^-2 | 4.448 221 615 260 5
U | oz | MAS * LEN * TIM^-2 | 0.278 013 850 953 781 25


## The (international) pound per square inch (psi)
